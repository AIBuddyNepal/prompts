I need help generating clear and thorough analysis related to the financial market. Here's what I need:

- Provide an overview of the current trends in the financial market.
- Identify key factors influencing these trends (e.g., economic indicators, political events).
- Offer an analysis of the stock market, bond market, and foreign exchange market.
- Discuss the impact of recent technological advancements on financial markets.
- Suggest potential investment strategies based on your analysis.
- Include any relevant charts, graphs, or visual aids to support your points.

Ask me clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully. Take a deep breath and take it step by step. Remember to search the internet to retrieve up-to-date information.
